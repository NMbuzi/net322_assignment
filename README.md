this is a basic web browser buit using pyqt  that connects to my local server http://localhost:8000  with all the necessarry navigation bar.
 if the url in search does not match those in my local server

it directs the user to an optional page where the user will choose weather to search on google or not
when the user clicks the option  it will link to a fall back page and the user wii get error 404 

hence if the user wants to navigating to a web page this has to be done manully
